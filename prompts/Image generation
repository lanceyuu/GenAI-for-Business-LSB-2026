Be specific but not overwhelming - Focus on meaningful details 
Use realism keywords: "photorealistic, 8K UHD, cinematic lighting, HDR" 
Reference real photographers/styles: "Annie Leibovitz style", "film noir aesthetic" 
Control composition: "rule of thirds", "shallow depth of field", "low-angle shot" 
Iterate systematically - Change one element at a time 
Make it not perfect – Imperfection makes perfect
